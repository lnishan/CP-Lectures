## Contributing Guidelines

### Principle
The guiding principle for this list is to connect more people to information and resources regarding Competitive Programming.
So thank you for paying an interest in this page :)

Please just note that this is a **curated** list which means it's not a complete catalogue of everything. I have a somewhat higher standard than most other Awesome Lists.

### TODOs
1. Better descriptions
2. More great resources from other regions (eg. Russian scene, BR ICPC Camp)
3. ICPC News site (eg. snarknews)
4. A short reference sheet
5. Anything you can think of!

### Submission
1. For new items or modifications, submit a pull request here ([learn how to](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)).
2. For dead links or suggestions, [create an issue](https://github.com/lnishan/awesome-competitive-programming/issues/new).
3. Or, you can simply [message me on Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/usertalk?other=lnishan).

### Rules
1. Please do not submit confidential resources (eg. handouts from closed training camps).
2. To add a new item or make modifications to the list, make sure you state your reasons (ie. Why is it awesome?).
